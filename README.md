(and also solution for an assignment in the course "Webbutveckling III" at MIUN taken HT20.
***
A random simon-says game with html, css and JS i made after my first course in JavaScript. Probably can redo it a bit better today.

Can be played at: [ameste.se](https://ameste.se/sim/simon.html)

Todo:

1. Read the code
2. Sound effects?
3. Rewrite the vode
4. Remake the game with Vue or React
